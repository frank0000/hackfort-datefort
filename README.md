# Datefort App
This app was originally developed for [Hackfort 2015](http://treefortmusicfest.com/hackfort) by @frank000 and team. View the [orginal repository](https://github.com/frank0000/hackfort-datefort).

City of Boise IT Department, @BoiseOpenData, modified the app to fit modified data sources and is hosting it, as per Hackfort prize agreement, at our boiseopenapps.org domain. If you have developed an app using City of Boise data, please let us know at boiseopendata@cityofboise.org.

## Data sources
Datefort relies on the [Boise Parks Amenities](http://opendata.cityofboise.org/datasets/7533d78ac95c45f88dba9b7d85e1c75c_0) open data set to find activities and locations in city parks and uses the Yelp API for nearby dinner options.
